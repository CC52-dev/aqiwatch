# Dokploy Deployment Quick Fix

## Issues Fixed

### ‚úÖ 1. "no healthcheck" Error
**Problem:** Docker HEALTHCHECK was missing from Dockerfile

**Fix:** Added HEALTHCHECK with extended startup period for ML model loading:
```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=120s --retries=5 \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost:5000/health || exit 1
```

**Why 120s start period?**
- TensorFlow model loading takes 30-60 seconds
- Container needs time to initialize before health checks
- Prevents false "unhealthy" status during startup

### ‚úÖ 2. Container Crashing Issue
**Problem:** Server was crashing every 30 seconds without clear error messages

**Fixes:**
1. **Enhanced error logging in `server.py`**
   - Shows current directory and files on error
   - Full stack traces
   - Better error messages

2. **Created `diagnose.py`**
   - Validates all dependencies
   - Checks model file exists
   - Tests imports before server starts

3. **Created `entrypoint.sh`**
   - Pre-flight checks before starting
   - Verifies model file exists
   - Runs diagnostics
   - Better startup logging

## Updated Files

### Dockerfile
```dockerfile
# Key changes:
- HEALTHCHECK with 120s start period (for model loading)
- Uses entrypoint.sh for better startup
- Sets proper permissions for all scripts
```

### entrypoint.sh (NEW)
```bash
# Pre-flight checks:
- Verifies model file exists
- Creates logs directory
- Runs diagnostic check
- Shows environment info
- Then starts monitor.py
```

### server.py
```python
# Better error handling:
- Shows directory contents on error
- Full traceback on failures
- Proper sys.exit(1) codes
- FileNotFoundError handling
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push Updated Files
```bash
cd /path/to/aqiwatch/ai-a
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Added healthcheck and improved error logging"
git push
```

### 2. Rebuild in Dokploy
In Dokploy dashboard:
1. Go to your deployment
2. Click "Redeploy" or trigger new build
3. Watch build logs

### 3. Monitor Deployment

#### Check Build Logs
Look for:
```
‚úì Model file found (21M)
‚úì Logs directory ready
Running diagnostic check...
[‚úì] All checks should pass
================================================
Launching Monitor Script
================================================
```

#### Check Container Logs
After deployment, look for:
```
[2025-10-13 ...] üå¨Ô∏è  AQI Server Monitor Started
[2025-10-13 ...] üöÄ Starting AQI server...
Loading AQI predictor...
Loading ML model from improved_aqi_model.h5...
‚úÖ AQI Predictor initialized successfully
üöÄ Server starting on http://0.0.0.0:5000
```

#### Check Health Endpoint
```bash
curl https://your-domain.com/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "predictor_loaded": true,
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "..."
}
```

## If Still Failing

### Get Detailed Logs
In Dokploy, run:
```bash
# View logs
docker logs <container-id> -n 200

# View error logs
docker exec <container-id> cat logs/server_stderr.log

# Run diagnostic
docker exec <container-id> python diagnose.py
```

### Common Issues After Fix

#### Issue 1: Model File Not in Container
**Check:**
```bash
docker exec <container-id> ls -lh improved_aqi_model.h5
```

**Solution:**
Ensure `.dockerignore` doesn't exclude `.h5` files. If it does, remove that line.

#### Issue 2: Timeout During Build
**Symptoms:** Build times out or gets killed

**Solution:**
The TensorFlow installation is large. In Dokploy settings:
- Increase build timeout to 10-15 minutes
- Ensure sufficient memory (2GB+ recommended)

#### Issue 3: Health Check Still Failing
**Check:**
```bash
docker exec <container-id> curl localhost:5000/health
```

**If curl fails:**
Server isn't starting. Check:
```bash
docker exec <container-id> cat logs/server_stderr.log
```

**If curl succeeds but Dokploy says unhealthy:**
Wait 2 minutes (start-period). The health check doesn't start immediately.

## Dokploy Configuration

### Recommended Settings

**Build:**
- Build timeout: 10 minutes
- Build memory: 2GB

**Deployment:**
- Health check grace period: 120 seconds
- Restart policy: always
- Memory limit: 1GB minimum

**Environment Variables (if needed):**
```
PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=3
```

## Success Indicators

‚úÖ Build completes without errors
‚úÖ Entrypoint script shows all checks passing
‚úÖ Monitor script starts successfully
‚úÖ Server initializes and loads model
‚úÖ Health check returns 200 OK after ~90 seconds
‚úÖ Container stays running (not restarting)

## Quick Test

After deployment:
```bash
# Test health
curl https://your-domain.com/health

# Test API
curl "https://your-domain.com/overview?lat=37.7749&lon=-122.4194&use_demo=true"
```

Both should return valid JSON responses.
